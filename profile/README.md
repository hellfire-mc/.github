# Welcome to Hellfire!

Hi! We're Hellfire, a small team of developers creating plugins for all of your Minecraft servers!

At Hellfire, we are aiming to develop a suite of inter-connecting plugins that can run on any server platform and architecture. We're talking [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/), [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), [Forge](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/ "Forge Homepage"), [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/), and even [Nukkit](https://github.com/Nukkit/Nukkit). Our plugins are designed to be as extensible and configurable as possible, giving you and your players the optimal experience.

## Our Projects

We have a number of ongoing projects to provide utility and services to your servers:

## Contributing

All of our plugins are open sourced, and are generally licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license. This means you can contribute, fork, pull request, and contribute as much as you want! You can find our organisation-wide contribution guidelines here.

If you wish to become part of the Hellfire team, we have an easy application process you can find [here]. Benefits of being a team member include:

- Creating your own Hellfire-branded plugins.
- Receiving a cut of all royalties made by Hellfire plugins.
